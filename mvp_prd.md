   - Note: Some features requiring JSON loading may not work due to CORS restrictions

### Recommended Development Setup
1. Start a local HTTP server from the `/site` directory:
   ```
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
3. All features should work as expected

### Development Notes
- The application is designed to work entirely client-side with no build step required
- JSON files in the `/data` directory serve as the data layer
