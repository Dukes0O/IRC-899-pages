        <h2>6.1 Purpose of This Tool</h2>
        <p><strong>Educational Objectives:</strong> This tool aims to provide a clear, accessible, and simplified explanation of the (hypothetical for this project) Section 899 of the Internal Revenue Code. It is designed to help users understand its main provisions, potential impacts, and key terminology without requiring prior deep legal or tax expertise.</p>
        <p><strong>Intended Audience:</strong> While primarily aimed at tax professionals, legal experts, and business owners with international operations who may need to understand such legislation, it is also structured to be informative for students, researchers, and policymakers interested in international tax law and trade policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> This is an educational MVP (Minimal Viable Product). It does not cover every aspect of Section 899, nor does it provide real-time updates on legal changes or country designations. The Impact Estimator uses simplified assumptions and should not be used for actual financial decisions.</p>

        <h2>6.2 Data Sources & Development</h2>
        <p>The content and structure of this tool are based on a hypothetical legislative framework for Section 899, as detailed in the project's planning documents. For a real-world tool, information would be drawn from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Official IRS guidance and publications.</li>
            <li>U.S. Treasury Department regulations and releases.</li>
            <li>The text of the Internal Revenue Code and related legislation.</li>
            <li>Authoritative commentary from tax and legal experts (used for explanatory context).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Development:</strong> This tool was developed as a static, locally-run website using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript, with data stored in local JSON files. This approach ensures accessibility without requiring a backend or internet connection for core functionality.</p>
