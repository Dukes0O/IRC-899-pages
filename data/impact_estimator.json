      "title": "Worked Example 1: Canadian SaaS Parent, US Sub, and Canada’s DST (Now in Effect)",
      "text": "<strong>Scenario</strong>\nA Canadian publicly traded SaaS company (“MapleCloud Inc.”) owns 100% of a US operating subsidiary (“MapleCloud USA”). The parent developed the proprietary software, which it licenses to MapleCloud USA for resale to US business customers. MapleCloud USA pays an annual royalty of $5 million to the Canadian parent for the right to market and distribute the software in the US.\n\nCanada enacts its Digital Services Tax (DST) effective January 1, 2026. The US Treasury lists Canada as a Discriminatory Foreign Country (DFC) under Section 899, effective the same date.\n\n<strong>Key Inputs</strong>\n\n<ul><li>US Sub’s Outbound Royalty to Canada: $5,000,000/year</li><li>Standard US–Canada Income Tax Treaty Royalty Withholding: 0% (Article XII(2) – most royalties are exempt from US WHT under this treaty for unrelated-party arrangements, unless for use of patents, trademarks, etc.; for most software, 0% if not “copyrighted article”)</li><li>Section 899 Surcharge:<ul><li>Year 1 (2026): +5% (so WHT becomes 5%)</li><li>Year 2 (2027): +10% (so WHT becomes 10%)</li><li>… (up to statutory 30% + 20% cap, but for most software royalties the practical maximum under §899 is 20%, since 30% statutory rate only applies to certain IP)</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n<strong>Step-by-Step Calculation</strong>\n<em>Year 1 (2026):</em>\nPre-Section 899:\n$0 US withholding (treaty rate applies)\nWith Section 899:\n\n<ul><li>$250,000 US withholding ($5,000,000 * 5%)</li><li>Extra annual cost: $250,000 (previously zero)</li></ul>\n\n<em>Year 2 (2027):</em>\nWith Section 899:\n\n<ul><li>$500,000 withheld ($5,000,000 * 10%)</li></ul>\n\n<em>Year 5 (2030), with +20% cap:</em>\nWith Section 899:\n\n<ul><li>$1,000,000 withheld ($5,000,000 * 20%) (new max under §899)</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Summary Table</strong>\n\n<table class='summary-table'><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>WHT Rate (Treaty)</th><th>WHT Rate (Section 899)</th><th>Withholding Tax</th><th>Extra Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pre-2026</td><td>0%</td><td>0%</td><td>$0</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>0%</td><td>5%</td><td>$250,000</td><td>$250,000</td></tr><tr><td>2027</td><td>0%</td><td>10%</td><td>$500,000</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>2030+</td><td>0%</td><td>20% (cap)</td><td>$1,000,000</td><td>$1,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<strong>Takeaways & Practical Notes</strong>\n\n<ul><li><em>Dramatic Swing:</em> The presence of Canada’s DST erases the traditional treaty protection (0% royalty WHT) that US–Canada SaaS models have relied on for decades, making US-to-Canada software/royalty flows far more expensive.</li><li><em>Escalating Pain:</em> The effect is modest in year one but grows rapidly (5% increments) until the cap, introducing urgency for business planning.</li><li><em>Applicability:</em> This scenario hits any Canadian SaaS company where the US sub licenses the IP and routes significant royalties back to Canada; substance in the US doesn’t change the exposure unless public company carveouts/regulation changes apply.</li><li><em>No US Corporate Tax Rate Change:</em> For a US sub paying royalties, Section 899 affects only the WHT on outbound payments (unless other applicable person tests or BEAT triggers are also present).</li><li><em>Annual Stakeholder Risk:</em> Canadian HQ, investors, and tax planners will have to monitor US compliance, manage forecasts, and may seek to restructure flows, e.g., via non-royalty service arrangements if possible.</li></ul>\n\n<strong>Narrative Executive Summary</strong>\nIf Canada enacts a DST, US subsidiaries of Canadian SaaS companies face a sudden and growing US withholding tax on royalty payments—even where the US–Canada treaty previously protected these flows. In Year 1 alone, a typical $5 million royalty payment would incur an unexpected US tax of $250,000; by Year 5, the cost rises to $1 million each year, underlining how Section 899 fundamentally reshapes cross-border SaaS economics between Canada and the US."

Just four years after Spain is blacklisted, a $15 million/year intra-group interest payment faces $4.5 million in US tax, three times the “normal” rate."
