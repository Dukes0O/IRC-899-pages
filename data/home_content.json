      "title": "What is Section 899?",
      "content": "Section 899 is a part of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code designed to counteract the effects of certain foreign taxes or subsidies that are deemed unfair or discriminatory, potentially harming U.S. businesses and distorting international trade. It provides mechanisms to impose additional taxes or adjust existing tax liabilities to level the playing field."
    },
    {
      "title": "Who is Affected?",
      "content": "This section impacts U.S. taxpayers (individuals and corporations) engaging in international transactions, particularly those dealing with entities in countries identified as having 'unfair foreign taxes.' It also affects foreign entities subject to these U.S. tax adjustments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Why Was It Implemented?",
      "content": "The rationale behind Section 899 is to protect U.S. economic interests, ensure fair competition, and respond to international tax practices that might erode the U.S. tax base or disadvantage American companies in the global market."

      "content": "Section 899 is a newly proposed 'retaliatory' code section designed to neutralize foreign tax measures that burden U.S. persons. Its core purpose is to discourage discriminatory or extraterritorial foreign taxes—such as digital-services taxes (DSTs) and undertaxed-profits rules (UTPRs)—that distort cross-border trade and erode U.S. tax revenues by increasing U.S. tax rates on 'applicable persons' from those jurisdictions."
